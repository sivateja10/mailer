This is the URL of the page that you need the user to be sent after the form submission.<br> You can choose the default redirect, so that the user will be sent to a page generated by Mailer containing a 'success message'. User can press 'back' on browser to come back to the page with the form.<br> If you want the user to stay in the same page after form submission, enter the URL of that page as the redirect URL.</li><li style=\"margin-top:20px;\">Once you successfully added the project, a link will be generated and displayed under My Projects.<br> Insert that URL as the \"action\" attribute of the form tag and also add \"method\" attribute as \"POST\", and you are done!</li><li style=\"margin-top:20px;\">Whenever a user submits your form, you will recieve an email with form data and the Project name in the head and subject.</li><li style=\"margin-top:20px;\">You can remove your projects anytime you want and the URL generated for that project is permenently discarded.
